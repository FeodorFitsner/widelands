     Widelands - an open-source strategy game


Introduction
------------

Widelands is a strategy game aiming for gameplay similar to Settlers II by
BlueByte.
In this game, you start out on a small piece of land with nothing more than
a few of useful resources. Using those, you can build yourself an empire
with many thousands of inhabitants. On your way towards this goal, you will
have to build up an economic infrastructure, explore the lands around you
and face enemies who are trying to rule the world just like you do.

As you can easily see, Widelands is currently an unplayable work in
progress. Your contributions (yes, I'm talking to you) are required,
especially in the area of graphics, to make Widelands an actual game.
