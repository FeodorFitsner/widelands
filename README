     Widelands - an open-source strategy game


Introduction
------------

Widelands is a strategy game aiming for gameplay similar to Settlers II by
BlueByte.
In this game, you start out on a small piece of land with nothing more than
a few of useful resources. Using those, you can build yourself an empire
with many thousands of inhabitants. On your way towards this goal, you will
have to build up an economic infrastructure, explore the lands around you
and face enemies who are trying to rule the world just like you do.

main menu.


Status
------

As you can easily see, Widelands is currently an unplayable work in
progress. Your contributions (yes, I'm talking to you) are required,
especially in the area of graphics, to make Widelands an actual game.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

If you want to report bugs, please send your report to the mailing list,
<widelands-public@list.sourceforge.net>
To subscribe, visit the following page:
http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/widelands-announce

Please provide enough background information. Tell us:
- what version of Widelands did you use (i.e. the build number, or whether it's
  a custom compile from CVS)
- how to reproduce the bug
- which map you were playing
- send us a compressed (zip, gzip, bzip2) session record if possible, unless the
  bug is trivial to reproduce. In fact, it may be a good idea to always record
  your sessions in case a bug surfaces. For more explanation, see below.


Creating a Session Record
-------------------------

Widelands can record all your keypresses and mouse movements to a file. It can
then replay an entire session from starting the game to exiting it. This is
really helpful for debugging problems.

To create a session record, start the game with the --record parameter. On
Linux, simply start Widelands like so:

$ ./widelands --record=filename.rec

On Windows, create a shortcut to the file widelands.exe (right-click on 
widelands.exe and choose Create Shortcut). Then edit the shortcut (right-click
on the newly created shortcut and choose Properties). The Target field should
read something like "c:\games\widelands\widelands.exe". Change this to
"c:\games\widelands\widelands.exe --record=filename.rec".

A binary file called filename.rec will be created.
To play it back, perform the same steps as outlined above, but replace 
"--record" with "--playback".

Note that while recorded files are platform independent, they generally won't
work across different versions of Widelands, because the user interface and the
order in which low-level functions can be called may change between versions.
Session records are not intended to serve as demo files; they are mostly a
debugging tool which helps us to track down bugs.
