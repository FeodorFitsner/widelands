CodeCheck is broken, seems to take the relative path to files:
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/user/widelands/build/src/wui/interactive_base.h'



Broke everything by attempting to split out src/io and build that separately!
Not sure what's going on but it seems like splitting out io itself worked, but the test suite is unhappy and refuse to link,
even though I've tried to add the same dependencies as widelands_io has.
I worked on src/logic/ earlier today, but ran into similar issues and reverted all my work, hoping that a smaller directory would be easier to deal with.

In general, it doesn't seem straight-forward to split things up into smaller sections since most directories include header files from two or three other directories. Knowing what depends on which other parts and potentially moving/refactoring things is probably necessary to make this work smoother. I would need help for the latter part though. (I wonder if it might be easier to do such changes in a separate branch/trunk though, to keep this delta smaller and avoid too many conflicts. Since trunk build everything at the same time it shouldn't notice a difference, but there should be a noticable gain here.)
(I didn't get doxygen to work (though I haven't used it before so probably user error) but I suspect there's cyclic dependencies lurking around.)

Atm there's a widelands_core library which is basically all the available header files. This is done to work around the various includes required from outside the directory in question. Long-term this should be reduced to the common subset necessary to boostrap building, and the rest of the libraries would then build once all their prerequisites are done. I think we should probably look closer into reducing this once we have split up into more parts and have a better grasp on how things are connected.
