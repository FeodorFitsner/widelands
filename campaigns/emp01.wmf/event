_"What has become of our Empire? I really ask this question, while my king disallowed me to fight against that monster of a barbarian tribe, that first acted like a peaceful friend and than attacked my army in the darkest night. <br>I got the the task to patrol on our northern frontier, which lies on the north of Galdin Mountains in a great, beautiful and ancient forest, with an army of 150 men. Soon we met a barbarian tribe, which at first was nice and friendly.  A few of my men even traded with them and their kids came to us, to admire our clean and tidy uniforms and weapons. But in our fifth night in that region, they attacked us without reason. I lost hundreds of good men, was enprisoned and finally was brought to the chieftain. He spit at me, laughed about me and told me to leave this land forever. He told me he doesn't want new land and doesn't want our land, but THIS forest was their land and will stay theirs until the ghosts take the last man of his folk!<br>Three weeks later, I came back to Fremil, to speak with our king. He was furious at the Barbarians, but disallowed an attack of these tribes anyway. He believed, that our army was too weak to resist in a war against the barbarians.<br>I saw no way, how I could erase my guilt, without fighting against the Barbarians and so I left Fremil by boat, to find a new world and a new life for me somewhere in the south. And now I am sailing southwards on the perl-gulf with my family, a few of my friends and a few of my best warriors."

_"Seems as if sailing on the perl-gulf was one of our biggest mistakes. Nature was against us and drove us in a dark, wild storm. I really don't know how many hours have passed, since the waves got higher than our boat, but still it would be suicide to go outside.<br>Our ship is badly damaged and is taking more and more water. We can thank the Gods if we survive this black night with just our lifes."

_"Finally the Gods were with us. We landed on an unknown coast and found a peaceful sleep under the palms growing at the strand. But that is about as good as it gets.<br>The truth is, when I woke up this morning, I saw nothing more than sand around us. It really seems as if we landed under the only palms existing in this far sandy desert. I fear, we won't find the help we need, to get our ship repaired in good time."
