[Build Food infrastructure]

descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* To produce some sustaining food for our miners, we could build up a tavern. To supply them with some good and strong drinks we could build up a brewery and a winery.<br> Of course this means we will need more resources for preparing this food like fish, meat or bread. To provide these foodstuff you would have to build a fisher's house, a farm, a mill and a bakery. Maybe you will also need a hunter's house, a piggery, a vineyard and some wells. It's up to you, what you want to build.<br> But remember - Coal and Iron Ore Mines need beer, Marble and Gold Mines need wine and all mines need at least rations, which are produced out of bread OR meat OR fish."
