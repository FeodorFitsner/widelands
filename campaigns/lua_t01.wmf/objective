[Build Lumberjack 1]
name=_ "Build a lumberjack's hut"
descr=_ ""<rt><p>"
_"* Press SPACE to see where you can build.<br> The red spots show you where a small building - like a lumberjack's hut - may be built.<br>"
_"* Build a lumberjack's hut at the red spot directly right of your headquarters by clicking at it and selecting lumberjack's hut.<br>"
_"* Build a road between your headquarters and the lumberjack's hut.<br> When you place the lumberjack's hut, a flag is created for it. You should connect it to another flag with a road.<br> If you click on a flag, little symbols will appear around it to show you in which directions you can build the road.<br> The colour of those symbols indicate how steep the road will be. Green is flat, yellow is steep and red is very steep. The steeper the step is, the harder it will be for your people to walk on it.<br> You can click on any of the symbols to build the first step of the road there. New symbols will appear to show you where the next step can go, and so on. However, you can also click further away to build several steps at once. Click on the flag at the headquarters to finish the road."

[Build Lumberjack 2]
name=_ "Build another lumberjack's hut"
descr=_ ""<rt><p>"
_"* Place a flag in the middle of the road.<br> There is a flag symbol in the mid of the way you just built. You place a flag there by clicking on the symbol and then clicking on the flag button in the consequently appearing menu. This splits the work of carrying the wood between two carriers.<br> When much wares are being transported between two points, additional flags in between make them get faster to their destination, thus improving your infrastructure.<br>"
_"* Place a lumberjack's hut directly south of the flag you just placed on the road. Connect the implied flag with the new lumberjack's hut afterwards.<br> Note that instead of building a road step by step, you may also directly click at the destination to build the entire road at once."
