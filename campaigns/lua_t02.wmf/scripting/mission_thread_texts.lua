The throne between the trees, the symbol of unity and peace among our kin became the wedge that drives us apart." ]] ..

There will be no end to this slaughtering, unless... is this it? As father told me?<br> Rise against whoever threatens our very existence, may it even be one of your blood or mind?" ]] ..

Perhaps it's time to give those who still live and think united a new home, replacing what is now lost to us? Until we can return to the place we once called our home..." ]] ..
