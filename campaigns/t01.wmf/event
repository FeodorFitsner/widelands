Wheb you place the lumberjack hut, a flag is created for it. You are expected to connect it to another flag with a road. Little symbols appear around the flag show in which directions you can build the road. The colour of those symbols indicate how steep the road will be. Green is flat, yellow is steep and red is very steep. The steeper the step is, the harder it will be for your people to walk on it. You can click on any of those symbols to build the first step of the road to it. New symbols will appear to show you where the next step can go, and so on. But you can also click further away to build several steps at once. Click on the flag at the headquarters to finish the road."

By clicking it and, in the consecutively opening menu, clicking the flag-button, you place a flag there, thus splitting the work of carrying the wood between two carriers. When much wares are being transported between two points, additional flags in between make them get faster to their destination, thus improving your infrastructure.
