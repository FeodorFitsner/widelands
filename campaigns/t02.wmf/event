I've spent nights laying awake, restless, more tired I ever believed one could be. Yet whenever I close my eyes I see the fortress my father built consumed by flames. The throne between the trees, the symbol of unity and peace among our kin became the wedge that drives us apart." "

None of my brothers will ever gain and hold control over the wooden throne, none of the tribes will be strong enough to subdue the other. There will be no end to this slaughtering, unless... is this it? As father told me? Rise against whoever threatens our very existance may it even be one of your blood or mind?" "
