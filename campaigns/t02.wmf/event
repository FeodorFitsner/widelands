_"* Enhance the coal mine and the tavern to the better versions of their buildings respectively.<br> A normal mine can only dig up about one third of all resources lying beneath it; then it must be enhanced to a deep mine in order to keep it working properly. To enhance a building, choose it and then click the appropriate button in the appearing menu.<br> Workers gain experience by successful work. With enough experience they become more advanced workers, who are necessary to operate the enhanced buildings. Do not enhance a building before you have enough advanced workers to operate the advanced building! Such buildings usually have greater demands than the basic kind of that building - for instance, deep mines need snacks instead of rations. You will have to enhance your tavern to an inn in order to produce snacks out of pitta bread AND a second kind of food (meat or fish). Note that the existence of inns does not make taverns obsolete - normal mines still require rations instead of snacks. You may of course enhance all mines to deep mines instantly - bigger mines work a bit faster, smaller mines need cheaper food. It's up to you which strategy you prefer."
