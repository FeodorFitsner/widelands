#  This is a village of poor but friendly people who have settled in a safe
#  valley between two glaciers. They hunt and grow timber and grain but they do
#  not have ores or even stones, so they are dependent on the occational
#  merchant that may pass by and provide them with whatever they can not
#  produce on their own. Their only protection is a guard hut at each entrance
#  to the valley. Therefore they realize that they may have to join a more
#  powerful society for protection in order to stay alive in this world.
#
#  A user that explores the map far from home will discover this village as a
#  bonus. Doing so is not necessary for winning.
#
#  Technically the village is created instantly when the player sees any of the
#  two entrances to the valley. But we place some trees and fields in various
#  stages of growth to make it seem like the village has actually existed for
#  some time. Some land ownership adjustments are made to ensure that the
#  village owns all land between the glaciers.
