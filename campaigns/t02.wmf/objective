[Claim Northeastern Rocks]
name=_"Expand your territory north-east"
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* Build military buildings (like sentries and strongholds) to expand your territory. Get to the rocks north-east from you and build a quarry there."

[Build Mines]
name=_"Start building mines on a mountain"
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* When you click at a flag you can send Geologists to implied flag. If that flag is on mountains, the Geologists will search the mountain for ores; otherwise, they will search for water. Place a flag up on the mountains flank to the east (on mountain terrain though, not mountain meadow) and send a Gelogist there. Then build a mine for both kinds of resource he will find, choosing the mine to be built appropriately:<br>Black - coal<br>Red - iron ore<br>Yellow - gold<br>Grey - granite<br> Mines may only be built on mountain terrain. Suitable places for mines are displayed with a light grey dot."

[Basic Food]
name=_"Provide your miners with food"
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* Build a hunter, a gamekeeper and a tavern.<br> In order to work, your miners need food. A hunter can hunt down animals, while a gamekeeper prevents them from becoming extinct. The meat is then processed in a tavern into lunches for your miners.<br>This is only the first example of a ware which has to be refined before being used in a secondary building - others will follow."

[Begin Farming]
name=_"Bake bread"
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* Build a well, a farm and a bakery.<br> Other ways to produce food - different kinds of food though - are fishers and farms. The wheat of the latter has to be processed with water in a bakery before it becomes edible. You can obtain water by building a well at a spot where your Geologists find a water source."

[Refine Ores]
name=_"Refine your mined resources"
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* Build a smelter and a charcoal burner. The iron ore your miners bring up is not usable yet - it has to be melted into iron first. Likewise, the pit coal from your coal mines must be refined into coal."

[Enhance Buildings]
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* Enhance the coal mine and the tavern to the better versions of their buildings respectively.<br> A normal mine can only dig up about one third of all resources lying beneath. Then it must be enhanced to a deep mine in order to keep it working properly. To enhance a building, choose it and then click the appropriate button in the appearing menu.<br> Workers gain experience by successful work. With enough experience they become more advanced workers, who are necessary to operate enhanced buildings. Do not enhance a building before you have enough advanced workers to operate the advanced building! Such buildings usually have greater demands than the basic kind of that building - for instance, deep mines need rations instead of snacks. You will have to enhance your tavern to an inn in order to produce rations out of pittabread AND a second kind of food (meat or fish). Note that the existance of inns does not make taverns obsolete - normal mines still require snacks instead of rations. You may of course enhance all mines to deep mines instantly - bigger mines work a bit faster, smaller mines need cheaper food. It's up to you which you prefer."

[Better Material I]
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* Build a wood hardener.<br> Bigger and better buildings - including all militarian ones - require better building materials. They cannot be built of simple trunks - the wood has to be refined to blackwood by a wood hardener first. Always remember to build a wood hardener before you run out of blackwood, for without that you cannot expand."

[Better Material II]
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* Build a Stonegrinder and a Well.<br> Better buildings may require also other improved materials besides blackwood. One of those is grindstone, which is produced out of water and raw stone by a Stonegrinder. You can obtain water by building a Well upon a water source, which your Geologists can discover when you send them to any flag that is not on a mountain by clicking said flag and the Geologist-symbol in the consecutively appearing menu."
