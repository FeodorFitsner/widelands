[Claim Northeastern Rocks]
name=_"Expand north-east and build a quarry"
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* Build military buildings (like sentries and strongholds) to expand your territory. Get to the rocks north-east from you and build a quarry there."

[Build Mines]
name=_"Start building mines on a mountain"
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* Build a coal mine and an iron ore mine.<br> Place a flag up on the mountains flank to the east (on mountain terrain though, not mountain meadow). When you click at implied flag you can send Geologists there. Because the flag is on mountains, the Geologists will search for ores; otherwise, they will search for water. Then build a mine for both kinds of resource he will find, choosing the mine to be built appropriately:<br> Black - coal<br> Red - iron ore<br> Yellow - gold<br> Grey - granite<br> Mines may only be built on mountain terrain. Suitable places for mines are displayed as hammer and pick."

[Basic Food]
name=_"Provide your miners with food"
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* Build a hunter, a gamekeeper and a tavern.<br> In order to work, your miners need food. A hunter can hunt down animals, while a gamekeeper prevents them from becoming extinct. The meat is then processed in a tavern into lunches for your miners.<br> This is only the first example of a ware which has to be refined before being used in a secondary building - others will follow."

[Begin Farming]
name=_"Bake bread"
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* Build a well, a farm and a bakery.<br> Other ways to produce food - different kinds of food though - are fishers and farms. The wheat of the latter has to be processed with water in a bakery before it becomes edible. You can obtain water by building a well at a spot where your Geologists find a water source."

[Refine Ores]
name=_"Refine your mined resources"
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* Build a smelting works.<br> The iron ore your miners bring up is not usable yet - it has to be melted into iron first."

[Enhance Buildings]
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* Enhance the coal mine and the tavern to the better versions of their buildings respectively.<br> A normal mine can only dig up about one third of all resources lying beneath. Then it must be enhanced to a deep mine in order to keep it working properly. To enhance a building, choose it and then click the appropriate button in the appearing menu.<br> Workers gain experience by successful work. With enough experience they become more advanced workers, who are necessary to operate enhanced buildings. Do not enhance a building before you have enough advanced workers to operate the advanced building! Such buildings usually have greater demands than the basic kind of that building - for instance, deep mines need snacks instead of rations. You will have to enhance your tavern to an inn in order to produce snacks out of pitta bread AND a second kind of food (meat or fish). Note that the existance of inns does not make taverns obsolete - normal mines still require rations instead of snacks. You may of course enhance all mines to deep mines instantly - bigger mines work a bit faster, smaller mines need cheaper food. It's up to you which strategy you prefer."

[Better Material I]
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* Build a wood hardener.<br> Bigger and better buildings - including all militarian ones - require better building materials. They cannot be built of simple trunks - the wood has to be refined to blackwood by a wood hardener first. Always remember to build a wood hardener before you run out of blackwood, for without that you cannot expand."

[Better Material II]
descr=_""<rt><p>"
_"* Build a lime kiln, a well and a charcoal burner or coal mine.<br> Better buildings may require also other improved materials besides blackwood. One of those is grout, which is produced out of raw stone, water and coal by a lime-burner. You can obtain water by building a well upon a water source, which your Geologists can discover when you send them to any flag that is not on a mountain by clicking said flag and the Geologist-symbol in the consecutively appearing menu. Coal can be obtained by building a charcoal burner or a coal mine."
