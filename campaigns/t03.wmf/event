_" "The traitor has left his armies dying where they lay as he saw that he would not keep my forces back. Kalitat disappeared in the mess of the war, but I donâ€™t care now. Shall he flee and be forgotten for all times as a tribeleader that would not bow before the wooden throne, that is mine to take now. Even more his flight brought us a big benefit: All year Kalitath was to busy fighting so that he did not even care to store enough food for all his men. Now that he fled the hunger brought some of his younger followers to desert. This group helds a strong fortification on the main ring. But there is more news: My scouts reported, that the two raging tribes of my brothers are in chaos and have barely noticed the new danger that is about to strike them. However they would not care if they noticed I guess, blinded by rage and hate, there is no sense left in them at all I believe." "

In none of all the ruins I found any man or woman of the normal folk and so I just may hope that they fled from this cruel battleground and started a better life somewhere else. Nothing is left from that beauty I remember, only ruins remain from the old capital. I am sorrowful but also relieved. I never hoped to ever see Al'thunrans old beauty again - some month ago I even wondered whether I will ever be able to set my feet near to Al'thunran again. Now the old town is back in my hands and I will not hesitate to rebuild it with all forces my people have. I can't wait to see it again in it's old beauty." "
