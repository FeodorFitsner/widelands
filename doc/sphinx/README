README for the Documentation
============================

This file contains the developer and content creator documentation for
Widelands. The documentation is generated with sphinx, you need to install this
if you want to build the documentation (modules py-sphinx or similar).

Building the documentation
--------------------------

First, extract the embedded documentation from the C++ code::

   $ ./extract_rst.py

Then, run ``make`` to see your options. Convenient for off-line reading is
``make html``.
