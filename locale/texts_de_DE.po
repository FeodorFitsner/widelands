"The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to "
"share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended "
"to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure "
"the software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies "
"to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program "
"whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation "
"software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You "
"can apply it to your programs, too.<br>When we speak of free software, we "
"are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are "
"designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free "
"software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source "
"code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use "
"pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things."
"<br>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone "
"to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These "
"restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute "
"copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>For example, if you "
"distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must "
"give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that "
"they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these "
"terms so they know their rights.<br>We protect your rights with two steps: "
"(1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you "
"legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.<br>Also, "
"for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone "
"understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the "
"software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients "
"to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems "
"introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations."
"<br>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  "
"We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will "
"individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program "
"proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be "
"licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>The precise "
"terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<br>"

msgstr ""

#: ../txts/COPYING:24
msgid ""
"1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code "
"as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and "
"appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and "
"disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this "
"License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of "
"the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>You may charge "
"a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your "
"option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>"
msgstr ""

#: ../txts/COPYING:26
msgid ""
"2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, "
"thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such "
"modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you "
"also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>a) You must cause the modified "
"files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the "
"date of any change.<br>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or "
"publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or "
"any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third "
"parties under the terms of this License.<br>c) If the modified program "
"normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when "
"started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print "
"or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a "
"notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a "
"warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these "
"conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.  "
"(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print "
"such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to "
"print an announcement.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../txts/COPYING:29
msgid ""
"These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable "
"sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be "
"reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then "
"this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you "
"distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections "
"as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of "
"the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other "
"licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part "
"regardless of who wrote it.<br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to "
"claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, "
"the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of "
"derivative or collective works based on the Program.<br>In addition, mere "
"aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or "
"with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution "
"medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License."

"3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under "
"Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 "
"and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br><br>a) "
"Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, "
"which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a "
"medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>b) Accompany it "
"with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third "
"party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source "
"distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source "
"code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a "
"medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>c) Accompany it "
"with the information you received as to the offer to distribute "

"4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as "

"terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance."

"5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed "
"it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the "
"Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you "
"do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the "
"Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of "

"6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the "

"infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), "
"conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or "
"otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not "
"excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so "
"as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any "
"other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute "
"the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit "
"royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies "
"directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both "
"it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the "
"Program."

"practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range "
"of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent "
"application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or "
"she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a "
