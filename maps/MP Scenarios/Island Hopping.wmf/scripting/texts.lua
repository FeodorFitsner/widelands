[[Island Hopping is a traditional tournament in the Atlantean culture. The
rules of the game are simple: You start with a headquarters one one island.
When you finish a castle at the end of the first island, you are granted a
second headquarters on a second island which will contain all wares from your
first headquarters.]]) .. p(_
[[If you finish a castle at the target area on the second island, you will get
a third headquarters on the third island. You must build and hold a castle at
the center of the third island for 20 minutes to win the game]]) .. p(_
[[Whenever you finish an island, you get bonus wares depending how many players
have finished the island before you. The earlier you finish, the less wares you
get. See below for the details.]]) .. p(_
[[The clue is that the first island only offers stones and wood, the second
only meadows and resources. The economies you leave behind will continue to
work for you, but you only reap the benefits when you reach a new island.]]
