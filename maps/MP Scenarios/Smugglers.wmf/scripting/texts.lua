to each other on an X-shaped island. Each player has a point in the
center of the map where he should place a warehouse. If both players in a
team succeed to build their warehouse in the right spot a smuggling route
is established: all wares from the top player that are delivered to his
warehouse are warped to the bottom player's warehouse. The aim of the game is to
smuggle %i items from top to bottom.]]) .. p(_
