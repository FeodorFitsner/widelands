Though his glorious reign, Chat’Karuth left his eldest son Thron in the due to succeed him as the tribes warlord – a decision that left his two brothers unsatisfied. The old warlord knew that. As his father told him, Thron left the capital of Al’thunran, the home of the throne among the trees and redrew his forces to the high hills where he buried the corpse of his father and swore to the gods and his spirit, that he’d return to re-established order. While his brothers raged in blind war against Thron and the few forces he left to secure the borders of Al’thunran, the young warlord seeks to reunite his ambitious brothers and force the tribes to march once again under a common banner."
