"When Chat’Karuth died, he was an old man, father to three strong and "

"left his eldest son Thron in the due to succeed him as the tribes warlord – "

"that. As his father told him, Thron left the capital of Al’thunran, the home "
"of the throne among the trees and redrew his forces to the high hills where "
"he buried the corpse of his father and swore to the gods and his spirit, "
"that he’d return to re-established order. While his brothers raged in blind "

"capital de Al’thunran, fogar da coroa entre as árbores, e levou ás súas "
"tropas cara as altas montañas, onde soterrou a seu pai e xurou aos deuses e "
"ao seu espírito que volvería restablecer a orde. Pero os seus irmáns "
"aproveitaron a ocasión para levantarse en armas contra el e as poucas tropas "
"que deixara protexendo as fronteiras de Al’thunran. Agora Thron intenta unir "
"de novo aos seus ambiciosos irmáns e obrigar ás tribos a camiñar, unha vez "
"máis, baixo un mesmo estandarte."
