" \"What has become of our Empire? I really ask this question - why did my "
"king forbid me from fighting against that monsterous barbarian tribe, who "
"first acted as a peaceful friend and then attacked my army in the darkest "
"night?<br> With an army of 150 men, I was assigned to patrol on our northern "
"frontier, which lies near the Galdin Mountains in a great, beautiful and "
"ancient forest. Soon, we met a barbarian tribe, which at first was friendly. "
"A few of my men even traded with them and their kids came to us, to admire "
"our clean and tidy uniforms and weapons.<br> But in our fifth night in that "
"region, they attacked us with no reason. I lost dozens of good men, and "
"found myself imprisoned and brought to their chieftain. He spat at me, "
"mocked me and told me to leave this land forever. He did not want new land "
"and did not want our land, but he told me that THIS forest was their land - "
"and would stay theirs until the ghosts take the last man of his folk!<br> "
"Three weeks later, I came back to Fremil to speak with our king. He was "
"furious at the Barbarians, yet disallowed an attack of these tribes. He "
"believed that our army was too weak to survive in a war against the "
"barbarians.<br> Still, I saw no way that I could erase my shame - without "
"fighting against the Barbarians. So I left Fremil by boat to find myself a "
"new world, and a new life, somewhere in the south. Now I am sailing on the "
"perl-gulf with my family, some of my friends and a few of my best "
