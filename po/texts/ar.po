"excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so "
"as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any "
"other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute "
"the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit "
"royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies "
"directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both "
"it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the "
"Program."

"هذه الرخصة، فلا يعد ذلك مبرراً لإعفائك مما توجبه هذه الرخصة. إن لم تكن "
"قادراً على الجمع بين الوفاء ببنود هذه الرخصة والوفاء بالتزامات أخرى ذات صلة، "
