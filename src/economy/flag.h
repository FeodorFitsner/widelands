/**
 * Flag represents a flag, obviously.
 * A flag itself doesn't do much. However, it can have up to 6 roads attached
 * to it. Instead of the WALK_NW road, it can also have a building attached to
 * it.
 * Flags also have a store of up to 8 wares.
 *
 * You can also assign an arbitrary number of "jobs" for a flag.
 * A job consists of a request for a worker, and the name of a program that the
 * worker is to execute. Once execution of the program has finished, the worker
 * will return to a warehouse.
 *
/// Important: Do not access m_roads directly. get_road() and others use
/// WALK_xx in all "direction" parameters.
