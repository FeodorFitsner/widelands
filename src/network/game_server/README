THIS IS NOT PART OF THE MAIN WIDELANDS BINARY AND SHOULD NOT BE LINKED TO IT

This directory contains the widelands game_server module for ggzd needed to run
widelands on a ggzd server. It is normally maintained in the official ggzd
distribution (in ggzd/game_servers/widelands) so changes in it's code should be
committed to their svn repository as well.

If you want to use this version (probably more up to date than the one in ggzd)
of the game_server module on your own server, download the newest ggzd from
www.ggzgamingzone.org, replace the files in ggzd/game_servers/widelands,
compile and run the server.
You can than run widelands with --metaserver=YOURSERVERADRESS to connect to
your own server.
