/*
 * The Overlay Manager is responsible for the map overlays. He
 * manages overlays in the following way:
 *   - When someone registered one (or more) special overlays
 *     for a field he draws them accordingly
 *   - If nothing was registered for this field, the Overlay Manager
 *     automatically returns
 *        - buildhelp (if activated)
 *
 *   Advantages are:
 *    - buildcaps do not need to be recalculated all the time
 *    - flexible system
 *
 *    about the level variable:
 *     the level describe when the overlay should be drawn
 *     buildhelp graphics have a level of 5, lower means the
 *     buildhelp will cover the old overlays, otherways the new
 *     overlay will cover the buildhelp.
 *
 *    about jobid:
 *     the jobid can be given to the register function, whenever
 *     the job is finished or canceld, a simple remove_overlay
 *     with the jobid can be called and all overlays created in the
 *     job are removed. This is useful for interactive road building.
