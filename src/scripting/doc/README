README for Scripting documentation
==================================

This file contains the documentation for the Lua scripting documentation. The
documentation is generated with sphinx, you need to install this if you want
to build the documentation (modules py-sphinx or similar).

Building the documentation
--------------------------

First, extract the embedded documentation from the C++ code::

   $ ./extract_rst.py

Then, run ``make`` to see your options. Convenient for off-line reading is
``make html``.
