==================

.. module:: wl.bases
   :synopsis: Base functions for common features in Game and Editor

.. moduleauthor:: The Widelands development team

.. currentmodule:: wl.bases

The :mod:`wl.bases` module contains Base functions on which the classes
of :mod:`wl.game` and :mod:`wl.editor` are based. You will not need
to create any of the functions in this module directly, but you might
use their functionality via the child classes.
