# NOCOM(#sirver): [out_of_resource_notification] ? fits better. Then you could only use 'title' and 'message'. You can also add a parameter here that defines when this message is send - you could put it to 10000 for wells (so no message gets send) and 10 for lumberjacks or so. You can also do this in a followup merge request if you want to.
