"<br><br>"
_"Widelands is a strategy game aiming for gameplay similar to Settlers II by BlueByte.<br>In this game, you start out on a small piece of land with nothing more than a few of useful resources. Using those, you can build yourself an empire with many thousands of inhabitants. On your way towards this goal, you will have to build up an economic infrastructure, explore the lands around you and face enemies who are trying to rule the world just like you do."

_"If you want to report bugs, please send your report to the mailing list, <widelands-public@list.sourceforge.net><br>To subscribe, visit the following page:"
"<br>"
"http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/widelands-public"
"<br>"
"<br>"
_"Please provide enough background information. Tell us:"
"<br>"
"<br>"
_"- what version of Widelands did you use (i.e. the build number, or whether it's<br>a custom compile from SVN)"
"<br>"
_"- how to reproduce the bug"
"<br>"
_"- which map you were playing"
"<br>"
_"- send us a compressed (zip, gzip, bzip2) replay if the bug appeared in-game. For more explanation, see the section on Replays below."
"<br>"
_"- send us a compressed (zip, gzip, bzip2) session record if possible, unless the<br>bug is trivial to reproduce. In fact, it may be a good idea to always record<br>your sessions in case a bug surfaces. For more explanation, see below."
"<br>"
"<br>"

"<p font-size=14 font-decoration=underline>"
_"Replays</p>"
"<p line-spacing=3 font-size=12>"
"<br><br>"
_"Widelands records every game you play in two files. One of these files has a .wrpl.wgf extension and contains an initial savegame. The other file has just a .wrpl extension and contains all commands that were issued by all players, such as building a road or attacking an enemy. The rest of the filenames will tell you the time you started the game."
"<br><br>"
_"Using the Watch Replay option in the main menu, a previously played game will be precisely reconstructed for you to watch. Note, however, that even small changes in the game data files or the Widelands executable can cause a replay to become incompatible and to 'go out of sync'. This is similar to how network games will suffer from desynchronization problems if one of the players has a different version of the game."
"<br><br>"
_"Replays are a very useful tool to find bugs in the game logic code, so we ask you to attach replay files to all bug reports that you submit. The replay files are saved in the ~/.widelands/replays directory in your home on Linux and in the replays subdirectory of your Widelands installation on Windows."

_"Creating a Session Record</p>"
"<p line-spacing=3 font-size=12>"
"<br><br>"
_"Widelands can record all your keypresses and mouse movements to a file. It can then replay an entire session from starting the game to exiting it. This is really helpful for debugging problems."
"<br>"
"<br>"
_"To create a session record, start the game with the --record parameter. On Linux, simply start Widelands like so: $ ./widelands --record=filename.rec"
"<br>"
"<br>"
_"On Windows, create a shortcut to the file widelands.exe (right-click on widelands.exe and choose Create Shortcut). Then edit the shortcut (right-click on the newly created shortcut and choose Properties). The Target field should read something like c:\games\widelands\widelands.exe. Change this to c:\games\widelands\widelands.exe --record=filename.rec."
"<br>"
"<br>"
_"A binary file called filename.rec will be created. To play it back, perform the same steps as outlined above, but replace --record with --playback."
"<br>"
"<br>"
_"Note that while recorded files are platform independent, they generally won't work across different versions of Widelands, because the user interface and the order in which low-level functions can be called may change between versions. Session records are not intended to serve as demo files; they are mostly a debugging tool which helps us to track down bugs."
