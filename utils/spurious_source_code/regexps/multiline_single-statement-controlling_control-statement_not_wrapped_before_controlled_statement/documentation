This was added to find some of the stuff that annoys Nicolai, such as:
   if (a) throw wexception
      ("Message explaining what went wrong, using format "
       "argument such as %u, %ill and %s",
       7, -9380350846789, "hej");

He requires it to be formatted like this instead:
   if (a)
      throw wexception
         ...

So a line with "for (a)", "if (a)" or "while (a)" must end with one of the characters in the string "){};\". Although a comment at the end is allowed (therefore the complex regexp).

It would indeed be inconsistent to wrap within the controlled statement without wrapping before it. A justification to do that would be to save vertical screen space.
