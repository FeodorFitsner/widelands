You need to compile widelands before you can compile this!

usage is simple:

make sure, that you have the files 32.bmp to 127.bmp (for the different ascii numbers) in 
the current directory. 
Then call:  wffcreate <fontname> <red value of clrkey> <green value of clrkey> <blue value of clrkey>

This will create the file <fontname>.wff. You can savly rename the file.
